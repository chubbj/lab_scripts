# Various scripts for analysing lab data

This repo contains various scripts and notebooks I use when analysing lab data and is intended mainly for members of the [Albanese Lab](https://www.albaneselab.com) but anyone is welcome to use it. 

Note most of this is optimised to work with a specific file output for specific lab set ups. I denote the hardware and software I use to generate data. You're welcome to use any of this code but note it might need to be tweaked for other setups.

This repo is in active developmen and highly subject to change.
